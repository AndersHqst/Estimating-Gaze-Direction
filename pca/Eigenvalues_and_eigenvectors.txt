Eigenvalues:
    Important in dynamic problems
    We now look at Ax = lx
    Assume alle matrices are square
    Eigenvectors:
        vectors x normally change direction when multiplied with A
        Eigenvectors do not!
            x is just scaled as an effect of being multiplied by A
        Multiply a eigenvector x with x, and we get an x multiplied by l
        l is the eigenvalue
        l tells us whether x is stretched, shrunk, or stays the same when multiplied with A
        l could be zero -> x is in the nullspace
            Because Ax = 0, then eigenvalue must be zero Ax = lx
        Most 2x2 matrices have two eigenvectors and two eigenvalues.
        We will show that det(A -lI) = 0
        By squaring A^2, the eigen vectors will keep their direction
        Markov matrix:
            Entries are positive, and columns add to 1
            Guarantees that the largest eigenvalue is 1
        Important:
            Special properties of a matrix, lead to special eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

        P, projection matrix
            In the plane it has two eigen vectors that lie in the plane
            One perpendicular to the plane
            l can be 0, 1

        Ax = lx <=> Ax - lx = 0 <=> (A - lI)x = 0
            Matrix A -lI times x makes the null space of A - lI

        Equation for the eigenvalue:
            The determinant of A - lI = 0
            l is an eigenvalue iff A - l I is singular

        Find eigenvalues (page 288):
            Subtract A- lI (lambda across diagonal)
            Take the determinant -> get somethiing like l^2 - 5l
            Set equal to 0 and sovle for l -> l=0 and l=5 as example
            Solve (A - li)x = 0 for these values of l to find eigenvector x
            A non zero solution exists if A is singular.
            For 2x2 matrices we end up solving 2 degree equations, 3rd order for 3x3 etc
            Algorithm for finding eigenvalues and vectors
                Compute determinant -> polynomial
                Solve the n roots
                for each eigenvalue l, solve (A - lI)x = 0 to find an eigenvector
            If we add a constant to the I vector, it is reflected in the eigenvalues, but not in the eigenvectors.
                Eigenvalues are scaled by the same constant.
            Note a nxn matrix will have n eigenvalues that may or may not be distinct
                These values might by complex numbers
            Exponent
                A^2x = AAx = Alx =lAx = llx == l^2x
                    -> A^n = l^nx (Important)

        Trace of a matrix
            sum of the diagonal (notice position of lambda values)

        Eigenvalues, properties
            the sum of the eigenvalues equals the trace
            the mul of the eigenvalues equals the determinant of the matrix
            A matrix is singular iff ..
            see slidesm there are 10

        Real eigenvalues
            values only, not complex

        The product of the eigenvalues equal the determinant
        The sum of th n eigenvalues equal to sum of the n diagonal entries

    Diagonalizing a matrix:
        S, matrix with eigenvectors on the columns, S time big lambda
        S^-1AS = Å , diagonalization of A
        A and Å have the same eigenvalues
        A^k = AÅ^kS^-1
            We have a practical solution to find the exponent.
            1 Find eigenvectors
            2 Find the inverse
            3 Multiply -> get the eksponent of A, by gettign the eksponents of the diagonal
        A lot of work has been done to find the eigenvalues and vectors so multiplication can be done efficiently
        If the diagonal eigenvalues are less than one, A^k approaches 0

        Diagonalization -> Eigenvalues must be different, which means that the eigenvectors are independent.

    Symmetric matrices A=A^T
        Has only real eigenvalues
        Are diagonalized, all eigenvalues are different
        Eigenvectors can be chosen orthonormal

    SVD
        Take any mXn matrix
        A = UDV^T
            U, D, and V have a clear characterization of A
